# LSS_Labs
This is my first Repository, for my LSS labs from last semester

I ended up getting a B+ in the lab course, even though I think I deserved higher, and most of the class had been using a variety of sources for the entire semester. Nonetheless, I thought that I would test out and learn some of the features of github in order to learn more about what it can offer me. It looks pretty promising. I could certainly use it as a daily journal, or for something even more functional, as I would like to keep daily journals more private, but I would like to not pay for an account as well.

This is certainly a good way to code with no hidden changes to the underlying files, however.
